# Sample

## Kotlin
The [Main application](/src/main/kotlin/emoji/core/Main.kt)  demonstrates how to use Emoji core to fetch emojis, using coroutines. </br>
For demonstration purposes `runBlocking` is used. For actual projects call `emojiDataSource.getAllEmojis()` in a non-blocking coroutine.

## Sample Android App
[Compose Emoji Picker](https://github.com/Abhimanyu14/compose-emoji-picker) internally uses Emoji Core for fetching the emojis.

# Dependencies

* kotlinx-coroutines-core
